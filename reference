                 Assessing the roles of neutrophils can be challenging,

              recruited macrophages originating from marrow precursors,
              tissue-resident macrophages are seeded before birth and function

                 cells to support angiogenesis and immunosuppression.
                 Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment [called
                 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)] often support tumor
                 growth and metastatic progression. Using a mix of in vivo and
                 coculture work with primary macrophages, Gomez et al. found
                 that secretion of the cytokine TGF-$\beta$ from
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs suppressed the abundance of succinate
                 dehydrogenase in breast cancer cells. The loss of this
                 metabolic enzyme promoted glycolysis, thereby enhancing tumor
                 growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Depleting
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs or blocking TGF-$\beta$ suppressed
                 these effects in vivo. The findings reveal a metabolic
                 mechanism underlying the protumorigenic roles of TAMs.
                 Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can exist in pro- and
                 anti-inflammatory states. Anti-inflammatory TAMs (also
                 referred to as M2-polarized) generally suppress antitumor
                 immune responses and enhance the metastatic progression of
                 cancer. To explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
                 isolated macrophages from mice and humans, polarized them ex
                 vivo, and examined their functional interaction with breast
                 cancer cells in culture and in mice. We found that
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs promoted a metabolic state in breast
                 cancer cells that supported various protumorigenic phenotypes.
                 Anti-inflammatory TAMs secreted the cytokine TGF-$\beta$ that,
                 upon engagement of its receptors in breast cancer cells,
                 suppressed the abundance of the transcription factor STAT1
                 and, consequently, decreased that of the metabolic enzyme
                 succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the tumor cells. The decrease
                 in SDH levels in tumor cells resulted in an accumulation of
                 succinate, which enhanced the stability of the transcription
                 factor HIF1$\alpha$ and reprogrammed cell metabolism to a
                 glycolytic state. TAM depletion-repletion experiments in a 4T1
                 mouse model additionally revealed that anti-inflammatory
                 macrophages promoted HIF-associated vascularization and
                 expression of the immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 in tumors.
                 The findings suggest that anti-inflammatory TAMs promote

                 mechanisms underlying TNBC immunobiology are incompletely
                 understood. Interleukin (IL)-17A is a pro-inflammatory
                 cytokine that has both pro- and anti-tumor effects and found
                 in 40-80\% of TNBC samples. We report here that IL-17A mRNA
                 and protein are detectable in some human TNBC cell lines and
                 further upregulated by IL-23 and LPS stimulation. Furthermore,
                 the impact of tumor-derived IL-17A in host immune response and

                 Compared to Addl-transduction, AdIL-17A-transduction enhanced
                 4T1 tumor growth and lung metastasis in vivo, which was
                 associated with a marked expansion of myeloid-derived
                 suppressor cells (MDSCs). However, AdIL-17A-transduction also

                 Administration of anti-Gr1 or anti-G-CSF antibody effectively

                 accumulation of bone marrow-derived cells in various tissues,
                 and these cells can enhance metastatic tumor growth by several
                 mechanisms. 4T1 murine mammary tumors are known to produce
                 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and increase the
                 numbers of immunosuppressive CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived
                 suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tissues such as the spleen and
                 lungs of tumor-bearing mice. While surgical resection of
                 primary tumors decreases MDSC levels in the spleen, the
                 longevity and impact of MDSCs and other immune cells in the
                 lungs after tumor resection have been less studied. METHODS:
                 We used mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) and flow
                 cytometry to quantify MDSCs in the spleen, peripheral blood,
                 and lungs of mice bearing orthotopic murine mammary tumors. We
                 also tested the effect of primary tumor resection and/or
                 gemcitabine treatment on the levels of MDSCs, other immune
                 suppressor and effector cells, and metastatic tumor cells in
                 the lungs. RESULTS: We have found that, similar to mice with
                 4T1 tumors, mice bearing metastatic 4T07 tumors also exhibit
                 accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in the spleen and lungs,
                 while tissues of mice with non-metastatic 67NR tumors do not
                 contain MDSCs. Mice with orthotopically implanted 4T1 tumors
                 have increased granulocytic (G-) MDSCs, monocytic (M-) MDSCs,
                 macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells in the lungs. Resection
                 of primary 4T1 tumors decreases G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs, and
                 macrophages in the lungs within 48 h, but significant numbers
                 of functional immunosuppressive G-MDSCs persist in the lungs
                 for 2 weeks after tumor resection, indicative of an
                 environment that can promote metastatic tumor growth. The
                 chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine depletes G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs,
                 macrophages, and eosinophils in the lungs of 4T1 tumor-bearing
                 mice, and we found that treating mice with gemcitabine after
                 primary tumor resection decreases residual G-MDSCs in the
                 lungs and decreases subsequent metastatic growth. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our data support the development of therapeutic strategies to
                 target MDSCs and to monitor MDSC levels before and after
                 primary tumor resection to enhance the effectiveness of

              prognosis and aggressive growth, with limited therapeutic options
              for many patients. Here, we use two syngeneic mouse TNBC models,
              4T1 and E0771, to investigate the chemo-immunogenic potential of
              cyclophosphamide and the mechanistic contributions of
              cyclophosphamide-activated type-I interferon (IFN) signaling to
              therapeutic activity. Chemically-activated cyclophosphamide
              induced robust IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$ receptor-1-dependent signaling
              linked to hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene responses in both TNBC
              lines. Further, in 4T1 tumors, cyclophosphamide given on a
              medium-dose, 6-day intermittent metronomic schedule induced
              strong IFN signaling but comparatively weak immune cell
              infiltration associated with long-term tumor growth stasis.
              Induction of IFN signaling was somewhat weaker in E0771 tumors
              but was followed by extensive downstream gene responses, robust
              immune cell infiltration and prolonged tumor regression. The
              immune dependence of these effective anti-tumor responses was
              established by CD8 T-cell immunodepletion, which blocked
              cyclophosphamide-induced E0771 tumor regression and led to tumor
              stasis followed by regrowth. Strikingly, IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$
              receptor-1 antibody blockade was even more effective in
              preventing E0771 immune cell infiltration and blocked the major
              tumor regression induced by cyclophosphamide treatment. Type-I
              IFN signaling is thus essential for the robust chemo-immunogenic
              response of these TNBC tumors to cyclophosphamide administered on
              a metronomic schedule. Significance TNBC has poor prognosis and
              few therapeutic options. We show that cyclophosphamide treatment
              can induces extensive tumor regression in syngeneic mouse models
              of TNBC via a chemo-immunogenic mechanism linked to type-I IFN
              production. Our findings establish that IFN signaling is
              essential for the robust anti-tumor actions of cyclophosphamide
              and suggest that treatment resistance may stem from silencing the
              IFN pathway. This suggests a new avenue for improving TNBC

              as a hemopoietic growth factor, IL-11 has an emerging role in
              epithelial cancer biology. Through the activation of the
              GP130-Janus kinase signaling cascade and associated transcription
              factor STAT3, IL-11 can confer many of the tumor intrinsic
              'hallmark' capabilities to neoplastic cells, if they express the
              ligand-specific IL-11R$\alpha$ receptor subunit. Accordingly,
              IL-11 signaling has recently been identified as a rate-limiting
              step for the growth tumors arising from the mucosa of the
              gastrointestinal tract. However, there is less appreciation for a
              potential role of IL-11 to support breast cancer progression,
              apart from its well documented capacity to facilitate bone
              metastasis. Here we review evidence that IL-11 expression in
              breast cancer correlates with poor disease outcome and discuss
              some of the molecular mechanisms that are likely to underpin
              these observations. These include the capacity of IL-11 to
              stimulate survival and proliferation of cancer cells alongside
              angiogenesis of the primary tumor and of metastatic progenies at
              distant organs. We review current strategies to interfere with
              IL-11 signaling and advocate that inhibition of IL-11 signaling
              may represent an emerging therapeutic opportunity for numerous
              cancers.",

              cell-intrinsic processes, existing approaches are suboptimal for
              identifying extracellular gene functions, particularly in the
              tissue context. Here, we developed an approach for spatial
              functional genomics called Perturb-map. We applied Perturb-map to
              knock out dozens of genes in parallel in a mouse model of lung
              cancer and simultaneously assessed how each knockout influenced
              tumor growth, histopathology, and immune composition. Moreover,
              we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased
              analysis of CRISPR-edited tumors. We found that in Tgfbr2
              knockout tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) was converted
              to a fibro-mucinous state, and T cells excluded, concomitant with
              upregulated TGF$\beta$ and TGF$\beta$-mediated fibroblast
              activation, indicating that TGF$\beta$-receptor loss on cancer
              cells increased TGF$\beta$ bioavailability and its
              immunosuppressive effects on the TME. These studies establish
              Perturb-map for functional genomics within the tissue at
              single-cell resolution with spatial architecture preserved and
              provide insight into how TGF$\beta$ responsiveness of cancer

  abstract = "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to attenuate
              acute lung injury (ALI). We also found that they can suppress the
              activation of alveolar macrophages (AMs), which can partly
              account for their therapeutic effects. MSCs do not inherently own
              immunosuppressive effects, when co-cultured with inflammatory
              immune cells, MSCs can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and
              meanwhile exert immunosuppressive effects. In order to further
              research, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of MSCs cultured before and
              after co-culturing with activated macrophages was performed. The
              data suggested a total of 5268 differentially expressed genes
              (DEGs) along the process. We used the data of 2754 upregulated
              DEGs to develop a signaling network of genes and the
              transcription factors targeting them in order to predict the
              altered functions of MSCs after exposure to inflammatory stimuli.
              This constructed network revealed some critical target genes and
              potential roles of MSCs under inflammatory conditions. According
              to the network, Ptgs2 was assumed to be an important gene
              participating in the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs. We also
              identified significant increases in the expression of COX2
              protein and the secretion of PGE2 from MSCs. The use of the COX2
              inhibitor NS-398 restrained the secretion of PGE2 and reversed
              the suppression of macrophage activation by MSCs in vitro. In
              addition, a selective antagonist of PGE2 binding receptor (EP4
              receptor), GW627368X, also reversed the inhibitory effects of
              MSCs on AMs and the protective effects in ALI mouse. In summary,
              the therapeutic effects of MSCs on ALI partly occur through
              suppressing AM activation via PGE2 binding to EP4 receptor.",
