                 growth and metastatic progression. Using a mix of in vivo and

                 Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can exist in pro- and
                 anti-inflammatory states. Anti-inflammatory TAMs (also
                 referred to as M2-polarized) generally suppress antitumor
                 immune responses and enhance the metastatic progression of
                 cancer. To explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
                 isolated macrophages from mice and humans, polarized them ex
                 vivo, and examined their functional interaction with breast
                 cancer cells in culture and in mice. We found that
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs promoted a metabolic state in breast
                 cancer cells that supported various protumorigenic phenotypes.
                 Anti-inflammatory TAMs secreted the cytokine TGF-$\beta$ that,
                 upon engagement of its receptors in breast cancer cells,
                 suppressed the abundance of the transcription factor STAT1
                 and, consequently, decreased that of the metabolic enzyme
                 succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the tumor cells. The decrease
                 in SDH levels in tumor cells resulted in an accumulation of
                 succinate, which enhanced the stability of the transcription
                 factor HIF1$\alpha$ and reprogrammed cell metabolism to a
                 glycolytic state. TAM depletion-repletion experiments in a 4T1
                 mouse model additionally revealed that anti-inflammatory
                 macrophages promoted HIF-associated vascularization and
                 expression of the immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 in tumors.
                 The findings suggest that anti-inflammatory TAMs promote
                 tumor-associated angiogenesis and immunosuppression by
                 altering metabolism in breast cancer cells.",

                 further upregulated by IL-23 and LPS stimulation. Furthermore,
                 the impact of tumor-derived IL-17A in host immune response and

                 accumulation of bone marrow-derived cells in various tissues,
                 and these cells can enhance metastatic tumor growth by several
                 mechanisms. 4T1 murine mammary tumors are known to produce
                 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and increase the
                 numbers of immunosuppressive CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived
                 suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tissues such as the spleen and
                 lungs of tumor-bearing mice. While surgical resection of
                 primary tumors decreases MDSC levels in the spleen, the
                 longevity and impact of MDSCs and other immune cells in the
                 lungs after tumor resection have been less studied. METHODS:
                 We used mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) and flow
                 cytometry to quantify MDSCs in the spleen, peripheral blood,
                 and lungs of mice bearing orthotopic murine mammary tumors. We
                 also tested the effect of primary tumor resection and/or
                 gemcitabine treatment on the levels of MDSCs, other immune
                 suppressor and effector cells, and metastatic tumor cells in
                 the lungs. RESULTS: We have found that, similar to mice with
                 4T1 tumors, mice bearing metastatic 4T07 tumors also exhibit
                 accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in the spleen and lungs,
                 while tissues of mice with non-metastatic 67NR tumors do not
                 contain MDSCs. Mice with orthotopically implanted 4T1 tumors
                 have increased granulocytic (G-) MDSCs, monocytic (M-) MDSCs,
                 macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells in the lungs. Resection
                 of primary 4T1 tumors decreases G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs, and
                 macrophages in the lungs within 48 h, but significant numbers
                 of functional immunosuppressive G-MDSCs persist in the lungs
                 for 2 weeks after tumor resection, indicative of an
                 environment that can promote metastatic tumor growth. The
                 chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine depletes G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs,
                 macrophages, and eosinophils in the lungs of 4T1 tumor-bearing
                 mice, and we found that treating mice with gemcitabine after
                 primary tumor resection decreases residual G-MDSCs in the
                 lungs and decreases subsequent metastatic growth. CONCLUSIONS:

              for many patients. Here, we use two syngeneic mouse TNBC models,
              4T1 and E0771, to investigate the chemo-immunogenic potential of
              cyclophosphamide and the mechanistic contributions of
              cyclophosphamide-activated type-I interferon (IFN) signaling to
              therapeutic activity. Chemically-activated cyclophosphamide
              induced robust IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$ receptor-1-dependent signaling
              linked to hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene responses in both TNBC
              lines. Further, in 4T1 tumors, cyclophosphamide given on a
              medium-dose, 6-day intermittent metronomic schedule induced
              strong IFN signaling but comparatively weak immune cell
              infiltration associated with long-term tumor growth stasis.
              Induction of IFN signaling was somewhat weaker in E0771 tumors
              but was followed by extensive downstream gene responses, robust
              immune cell infiltration and prolonged tumor regression. The
              immune dependence of these effective anti-tumor responses was
              established by CD8 T-cell immunodepletion, which blocked
              cyclophosphamide-induced E0771 tumor regression and led to tumor
              stasis followed by regrowth. Strikingly, IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$
              receptor-1 antibody blockade was even more effective in
              preventing E0771 immune cell infiltration and blocked the major
              tumor regression induced by cyclophosphamide treatment. Type-I
              IFN signaling is thus essential for the robust chemo-immunogenic
              response of these TNBC tumors to cyclophosphamide administered on
              a metronomic schedule. Significance TNBC has poor prognosis and
              few therapeutic options. We show that cyclophosphamide treatment
              can induces extensive tumor regression in syngeneic mouse models
              of TNBC via a chemo-immunogenic mechanism linked to type-I IFN
              production. Our findings establish that IFN signaling is
              essential for the robust anti-tumor actions of cyclophosphamide
              and suggest that treatment resistance may stem from silencing the
              IFN pathway. This suggests a new avenue for improving TNBC

              immunosuppressive effects, when co-cultured with inflammatory
              immune cells, MSCs can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and
              meanwhile exert immunosuppressive effects. In order to further
              research, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of MSCs cultured before and
              after co-culturing with activated macrophages was performed. The
              data suggested a total of 5268 differentially expressed genes
              (DEGs) along the process. We used the data of 2754 upregulated
              DEGs to develop a signaling network of genes and the
              transcription factors targeting them in order to predict the
              altered functions of MSCs after exposure to inflammatory stimuli.
              This constructed network revealed some critical target genes and

              to the network, Ptgs2 was assumed to be an important gene

  abstract = "IRE1$\alpha$ is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized
              endonuclease activated by misfolded proteins in the ER.
              Previously, we demonstrated that IRE1$\alpha$ forms a complex
              with the Sec61 translocon, to which its substrate XBP1u mRNA is
              recruited for cleavage during ER stress (Plumb et al., 2015).
              Here, we probe IRE1$\alpha$ complexes in cells with blue native
              PAGE immunoblotting. We find that IRE1$\alpha$ forms a
              hetero-oligomeric complex with the Sec61 translocon that is
              activated upon ER stress with little change in the complex. In
              addition, IRE1$\alpha$ oligomerization, activation, and
              inactivation during ER stress are regulated by Sec61. Loss of the
              IRE1$\alpha$-Sec61 translocon interaction as well as severe ER
              stress conditions causes IRE1$\alpha$ to form higher-order
              oligomers that exhibit continuous activation and extended
              cleavage of XBP1u mRNA. Thus, we propose that the
              Sec61-IRE1$\alpha$ complex defines the extent of IRE1$\alpha$
              activity and may determine cell fate decisions during ER stress

              Conversely, IRE1-which harbors both kinase and endoribonuclease

              IRE1's attenuation through a phosphatase known as RPAP2 (RNA

  abstract = "Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential
              cell function. To safeguard this process in the face of
              environmental threats and internal stressors, cells mount an
              evolutionarily conserved response known as the unfolded protein
              response (UPR). Invading pathogens induce cellular stress that
              impacts protein folding, thus the UPR is well situated to sense
              danger and contribute to immune responses. Cytokines
              (inflammatory cytokines and interferons) critically mediate host
              defense against pathogens, but when aberrantly produced, may also
              drive pathologic inflammation. The UPR influences cytokine
              production on multiple levels, from stimulation of pattern
              recognition receptors, to modulation of inflammatory signaling
              pathways, and the regulation of cytokine transcription factors.
              This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying cytokine
              regulation by the UPR, and the repercussions of this relationship
              for infection and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases.
              Interrogation of viral and bacterial infections has revealed
              increasing numbers of examples where pathogens induce or modulate
              the UPR and implicated UPR-modulated cytokines in host response.
              The flip side of this coin, the UPR/ER stress responses have been
              increasingly recognized in a variety of autoimmune and
              inflammatory diseases. Examples include monogenic disorders of ER
              function, diseases linked to misfolding protein (HLA-B27 and
              spondyloarthritis), diseases directly implicating UPR and

              diseases targeting highly secretory cells (e.g., diabetes). Given
              the burgeoning interest in pharmacologically targeting the UPR,
              greater discernment is needed regarding how the UPR regulates
              cytokine production during specific infections and autoimmune

               this trafficking process has not been fully elucidated yet. In
               this study, we identified YIPF5 as a positive regulator of STING
               trafficking. YIPF5 is essential for DNA virus- or intracellular
               DNA-triggered production of type I IFNs. Consistently, knockdown
               of YIPF5 impairs cellular antiviral responses to DNA virus.
               Mechanistically, YIPF5 interacts with both STING and components

               cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), produced by the
               DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is important
               for the innate immune response to microbial infection and
               autoimmune disease. Modes of STING activation that are
               independent of cGAS are much less well understood. Here, through
               a spatiotemporally resolved proximity labelling screen followed
               by quantitative proteomics, we identify the lysosomal membrane
               protein Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) as a cofactor in the
               trafficking of STING. NPC1 interacts with STING and recruits it
               to the lysosome for degradation in both human and mouse cells.
               Notably, we find that knockout of Npc1 'primes' STING signalling
               by physically linking or 'tethering' STING to SREBP2
               trafficking. Loss of NPC1 protein also 'boosts' STING signalling

              endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. This sensitivity to ER
              perturbations is caused by the synthesis and secretion of large
              quantities of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by EMT cells.
              Consistent with their increased secretory output, EMT cells

              (TIL) is associated with prolonged survival in high-grade serous
              ovarian cancer (HGSC) and other epithelial cancers. Survival is
              most strongly associated with intraepithelial versus intrastromal
              CD8(+) TILs; however, the mechanisms that promote the
              intraepithelial localization of TILs remain poorly understood. We
              hypothesized that intraepithelial CD8(+) TILs, like normal
              mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes, might express CD103, a
              subunit of $\alpha$E/$\beta$7 integrin, which binds E-cadherin on
              epithelial cells. METHODS: A large collection of primary ovarian
              tumors (HGSC, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell) was
              analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of
              TIL-expressing CD103. The activation and differentiation status
              of CD103(+) TILs were assessed by flow cytometry. The prognostic
              significance of TIL subsets was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier
              analysis. RESULTS: CD103(+) TILs were present in all major
              ovarian cancer subtypes and were most abundant in HGSC. CD103(+)
              TILs were preferentially localized to epithelial regions of
              tumors and were comprised predominantly of CD8(+) T cells
              expressing activation (HLA-DR, Ki-67, PD-1) and cytolytic (TIA-1)
              markers, as well as CD56(+) NK cells. Tumor infiltration by
              CD103(+) TILs was strongly associated with patient survival in
              HGSC. Tumors containing CD8(+) TILs that were CD103(-) showed
              poor prognosis equivalent to tumors lacking CD8(+) TILs
              altogether. CONCLUSIONS: CD103(+) TILs comprise intraepithelial,
              activated CD8(+) T cells, and NK cells and are strongly
              associated with patient survival in HGSC. CD103 may serve as a

              clinical attributes, which might result from distinct tumor
              microenvironments that promote differentiation into distinct
              subsets. However, only a few markers have been identified that
              can define CD8(+) T-cell subsets. CD103 is a marker of tissue
              resident memory CD8(+) T cells. In this retrospective study we
              investigated the cellular source and clinical significance of
              CD103 expression in urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder tissues
              in situ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and
              immunofluorescence were used to identify the cellular source of
              CD103 in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier
              analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were
              applied to estimate overall and recurrence-free survival in 302
              patients with bladder urothelial cell carcinoma. RESULTS: CD8(+)
              T cells but not natural killer cells accounted for most CD103
              expressing cells in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues.
              Notably CD103(+) cells were predominantly located in intratumor
              regions rather than in associated stroma (p < 0.0001). The
              density of intratumor CD103(+) TILs was inversely associated with
              tumor size (p < 0.0001) and could represent a favorable
              prognostic predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival (p =
              0.002 and 0.011, respectively). Moreover, intratumor CD103(+)
              TILs were positively associated with the expression of cognate
              ligand E-cadherin in intratumor regions of bladder urothelial
              cell carcinoma tissues (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              suggest that CD8(+) T cells might have a significant role in
              tumor immunity by expressing CD103 in intratumor regions of
              bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues. Intratumor CD103(+)

              fills the niche with ineffective yet cytokine-dependent TILs, and
              we propose that these might compete with new clones, when they

              (Fabp4/Fabp5) impairs exogenous free fatty acid (FFA) uptake by

              Moreover, skin CD8+ TRM cells that lacked Fabp4/Fabp5 were less

              longevity and function of CD8+ TRM cells, and suggest that CD8+

              the characteristics of the cells that initiate antitumor immune
              response.Patients and Methods: We performed multiparameter flow

              cancer-immune equilibrium1-can be maintained for prolonged
              periods of time, possibly up to several decades2-4. Although

              cutaneous melanoma5, we show that tissue-resident memory CD8+ T
              cells (TRM cells) promote a durable melanoma-immune equilibrium
              that is confined to the epidermal layer of the skin. A proportion
              of mice (~40\%) transplanted with melanoma cells remained free of
              macroscopic skin lesions long after epicutaneous inoculation, and
              generation of tumour-specific epidermal CD69+ CD103+ TRM cells
              correlated with this spontaneous disease control. By contrast,
              mice deficient in TRM formation were more susceptible to tumour
              development. Despite being tumour-free at the macroscopic level,
              mice frequently harboured melanoma cells in the epidermal layer
              of the skin long after inoculation, and intravital imaging
              revealed that these cells were dynamically surveyed by TRM cells.
              Consistent with their role in melanoma surveillance,
              tumour-specific TRM cells that were generated before melanoma
              inoculation conferred profound protection from tumour development
              independently of recirculating T cells. Finally, depletion of TRM

  abstract = "Epithelial resident memory T (eTRM) cells serve as sentinels in
              barrier tissues to guard against previously encountered
              pathogens. How eTRM cells are generated has important
              implications for efforts to elicit their formation through
              vaccination or prevent it in autoimmune disease. Here, we show
              that during immune homeostasis, the cytokine transforming growth
              factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) epigenetically conditions resting
              na{\"\i}ve CD8+ T cells and prepares them for the formation of
              eTRM cells in a mouse model of skin vaccination. Na{\"\i}ve T
              cell conditioning occurs in lymph nodes (LNs), but not in the
              spleen, through major histocompatibility complex class
              I-dependent interactions with peripheral tissue-derived migratory
              dendritic cells (DCs) and depends on DC expression of
              TGF-$\beta$-activating $\alpha$V integrins. Thus, the preimmune T
              cell repertoire is actively conditioned for a specialized memory
              differentiation fate through signals restricted to LNs.",
