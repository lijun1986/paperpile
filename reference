              acute lung injury (ALI). We also found that they can suppress the
              activation of alveolar macrophages (AMs), which can partly
              account for their therapeutic effects. MSCs do not inherently own
              immunosuppressive effects, when co-cultured with inflammatory
              immune cells, MSCs can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and
              meanwhile exert immunosuppressive effects. In order to further
              research, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of MSCs cultured before and
              after co-culturing with activated macrophages was performed. The
              data suggested a total of 5268 differentially expressed genes
              (DEGs) along the process. We used the data of 2754 upregulated
              DEGs to develop a signaling network of genes and the
              transcription factors targeting them in order to predict the
              altered functions of MSCs after exposure to inflammatory stimuli.
              This constructed network revealed some critical target genes and
              potential roles of MSCs under inflammatory conditions. According
              to the network, Ptgs2 was assumed to be an important gene
              participating in the immunosuppressive effects of MSCs. We also
              identified significant increases in the expression of COX2
              protein and the secretion of PGE2 from MSCs. The use of the COX2
              inhibitor NS-398 restrained the secretion of PGE2 and reversed
              the suppression of macrophage activation by MSCs in vitro. In
              addition, a selective antagonist of PGE2 binding receptor (EP4
              receptor), GW627368X, also reversed the inhibitory effects of
              MSCs on AMs and the protective effects in ALI mouse. In summary,
              the therapeutic effects of MSCs on ALI partly occur through
              suppressing AM activation via PGE2 binding to EP4 receptor.",

              responses remains poorly described. Here, we investigate the role
              of the UPR mediator pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase
              (PERK) in cancer cells in the modulation of anti-tumor immunity.
              Deletion of PERK in cancer cells or pharmacological inhibition of

              anti-tumor T cell immunity and attenuates tumor growth. PERK
              elimination in ER-stressed malignant cells triggers
              SEC61$\beta$-induced paraptosis, thereby promoting immunogenic
              cell death (ICD) and systemic anti-tumor responses. ICD induction
              in PERK-ablated tumors stimulates type I interferon production in
              dendritic cells (DCs), which primes CCR2-dependent tumor
              trafficking of common-monocytic precursors and their intra-tumor
              commitment into monocytic-lineage inflammatory Ly6C+CD103+ DCs.

                 proliferative expansion in response to tumor stimuli. CD169+
                 LN macrophage depletion, using an anti-CSF-1R antibody or
                 clodronate-loaded liposomes, leads to increased metastatic
                 burden in two mouse breast cancer models. The expansion of
                 CD169+ macrophages is tightly connected to B cell expansion in
                 tumor-draining LNs, and B cell depletion abrogates the effect
                 of CD169+ macrophage absence on metastasis, indicating that
                 the CD169+ macrophage anti-metastatic effects require B cell
                 presence. These results reveal a protective role of CD169+ LN

              carcinoma (HCC), in particular the role and clinical relevance of
              exhausted and liver-resident T cells remain unclear. We therefore
              dissected the landscape of exhausted and resident T cell
              responses in the peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment of
              patients with HCC. METHODS: Lymphocytes were isolated from the
              blood, tumor and tumor-surrounding liver tissue of patients with
              HCC (n = 40, n = 10 treated with anti-PD-1 therapy). Phenotype,
              function and response to anti-PD-1 were analyzed by mass and flow
              cytometry ex vivo and in vitro, tissue residence was further
              assessed by immunohistochemistry and imaging mass cytometry. Gene
              signatures were analyzed in silico. RESULTS: We identified
              significant enrichment of heterogeneous populations of exhausted
              CD8+ T cells (TEX) in the tumor microenvironment. Strong
              enrichment of severely exhausted CD8 T cells expressing multiple
              immune checkpoints in addition to PD-1 was linked to poor
              progression-free and overall survival. In contrast, PD-1 was also
              expressed on a subset of more functional and metabolically active
              CD103+ tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that expressed few
              additional immune checkpoints and were associated with better
              survival. TEX enrichment was independent of BCLC stage,
              alpha-fetoprotein levels or age as a variable for
              progression-free survival in our cohort. These findings were in
              line with in silico gene signature analysis of HCC tumor
              transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas. A higher baseline
              TRM/TEX ratio was associated with disease control in
              anti-PD-1-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Our data provide
              information on the role of peripheral and intratumoral TEX-TRM
              dynamics in determining outcomes in patients with HCC. The
              dynamics between exhausted and liver-resident T cells have
              implications for immune-based diagnostics, rational patient
              selection and monitoring during HCC immunotherapies. LAY SUMMARY:
              The role of the immune response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
              remains unclear. T cells can mediate protection against tumor
              cells but are frequently dysfunctional and exhausted in cancer.
              We found that patients with a predominance of exhausted CD8+ T
              cells (TEX) had poor survival compared to patients with a
              predominance of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM). This
              correlated with the molecular profile, metabolic and functional
              status of these cell populations. The enrichment of TEX was
              independently associated with prognosis in addition to disease
              stage, age and tumor markers. A high TRM proportion was also
              associated with better outcomes following checkpoint therapy.
              Thus, these T-cell populations are novel biomarkers with
              relevance in HCC.",

              clinical attributes, which might result from distinct tumor
              microenvironments that promote differentiation into distinct
              subsets. However, only a few markers have been identified that
              can define CD8(+) T-cell subsets. CD103 is a marker of tissue
              resident memory CD8(+) T cells. In this retrospective study we
              investigated the cellular source and clinical significance of
              CD103 expression in urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder tissues
              in situ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry and
              immunofluorescence were used to identify the cellular source of
              CD103 in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues. Kaplan-Meier
              analysis and Cox proportional hazards regression models were
              applied to estimate overall and recurrence-free survival in 302
              patients with bladder urothelial cell carcinoma. RESULTS: CD8(+)
              T cells but not natural killer cells accounted for most CD103
              expressing cells in bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues.
              Notably CD103(+) cells were predominantly located in intratumor
              regions rather than in associated stroma (p < 0.0001). The
              density of intratumor CD103(+) TILs was inversely associated with
              tumor size (p < 0.0001) and could represent a favorable
              prognostic predictor of overall and recurrence-free survival (p =
              0.002 and 0.011, respectively). Moreover, intratumor CD103(+)
              TILs were positively associated with the expression of cognate
              ligand E-cadherin in intratumor regions of bladder urothelial
              cell carcinoma tissues (p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
              suggest that CD8(+) T cells might have a significant role in
              tumor immunity by expressing CD103 in intratumor regions of
              bladder urothelial cell carcinoma tissues. Intratumor CD103(+)

              Conversely, IRE1-which harbors both kinase and endoribonuclease

              (Fabp4/Fabp5) impairs exogenous free fatty acid (FFA) uptake by
              CD8+ TRM cells and greatly reduces their long-term survival in
              vivo, while having no effect on the survival of central memory T
              (TCM) cells in lymph nodes. In vitro, CD8+ TRM cells, but not
              CD8+ TCM cells, demonstrated increased mitochondrial oxidative
              metabolism in the presence of exogenous FFAs; this increase was
              not seen in Fabp4/Fabp5 double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells. The
              persistence of CD8+ TRM cells in the skin was strongly diminished
              by inhibition of mitochondrial FFA $\beta$-oxidation in vivo.
              Moreover, skin CD8+ TRM cells that lacked Fabp4/Fabp5 were less
              effective at protecting mice from cutaneous viral infection, and
              lung Fabp4/Fabp5 double-knockout CD8+ TRM cells generated by skin

              supported the expression of crucial tissue-residency genes while

              malignancies, are thought to activate anti-tumour immune response
              and affect therapeutic sensitivity including both immunotherapy
              and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT). METHODS: Totally 650
              muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients from three
              independent cohorts were included in this study for survival and
              cisplatin-based ACT response analysis. Another public data set
              consisting of 195 patients from IMvigor210 trial receiving PD-L1
              blockade were involved in the assessment of immunotherapeutic
              response. Fifty-nine fresh tumour tissues were used to evaluate
              immune infiltration of CD103+CD8+ TRM cells. RESULTS: Patients
              with high CD103+CD8+ TRM cells infiltration, but not CD8+ T
              cells, are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy and ACT. The
              presence of TRM cells is highly associated with an enhanced
              IFN$\gamma$-enriched and T cell-inflamed anti-tumour
              microenvironment. Elevated CD103+CD8+ TRM cells infiltration
              correlated with superior ACT response in mismatch repair (MMR),

              crucial role in anti-tumour immunity and served as an ideal
              prognostic biomarker. It could be treated as a superior companion

              cancer-immune equilibrium1-can be maintained for prolonged

              cutaneous melanoma5, we show that tissue-resident memory CD8+ T
              cells (TRM cells) promote a durable melanoma-immune equilibrium
              that is confined to the epidermal layer of the skin. A proportion
              of mice (~40\%) transplanted with melanoma cells remained free of
              macroscopic skin lesions long after epicutaneous inoculation, and
              generation of tumour-specific epidermal CD69+ CD103+ TRM cells
              correlated with this spontaneous disease control. By contrast,
              mice deficient in TRM formation were more susceptible to tumour
              development. Despite being tumour-free at the macroscopic level,
              mice frequently harboured melanoma cells in the epidermal layer
              of the skin long after inoculation, and intravital imaging
              revealed that these cells were dynamically surveyed by TRM cells.
              Consistent with their role in melanoma surveillance,
              tumour-specific TRM cells that were generated before melanoma
              inoculation conferred profound protection from tumour development

              a fundamental role in the surveillance of subclinical melanomas
              in the skin by maintaining cancer-immune equilibrium. As such,

              Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell
              dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL).
              However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens2,
              and little is known about transcriptional programs of
              MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones
              using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay3 in
              neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers
              (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a 'barcode' to track
              and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour
              microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T
              cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific
              clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and
              Epstein-Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional
              programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL
              express an incompletely activated cytolytic program.
              MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs
              of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of
              interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less
              responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with
              influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding

               cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), produced by the
               DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is important
               for the innate immune response to microbial infection and
               autoimmune disease. Modes of STING activation that are
               independent of cGAS are much less well understood. Here, through
               a spatiotemporally resolved proximity labelling screen followed
               by quantitative proteomics, we identify the lysosomal membrane
               protein Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) as a cofactor in the
               trafficking of STING. NPC1 interacts with STING and recruits it
               to the lysosome for degradation in both human and mouse cells.
               Notably, we find that knockout of Npc1 'primes' STING signalling
               by physically linking or 'tethering' STING to SREBP2
               trafficking. Loss of NPC1 protein also 'boosts' STING signalling
               by blocking lysosomal degradation. Both priming and boosting of
               STING signalling are required for severe neurological disease in
               the Npc1-/- mouse. Genetic deletion of Sting1 (the gene that

               reduced the activation of microglia and relieved the loss of
               Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice, leading to
               improved motor function. Our study identifies a cGAS- and

                 the impact of tumor-derived IL-17A in host immune response and

              of DNA has occurred in BALB/cBy (Qa-2-) mice relative to BALB/c
              (Qa-2+) mice. We propose that this deletion arises from unequal

              4T1 and E0771, to investigate the chemo-immunogenic potential of
              cyclophosphamide and the mechanistic contributions of
              cyclophosphamide-activated type-I interferon (IFN) signaling to
              therapeutic activity. Chemically-activated cyclophosphamide
              induced robust IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$ receptor-1-dependent signaling
              linked to hundreds of IFN-stimulated gene responses in both TNBC
              lines. Further, in 4T1 tumors, cyclophosphamide given on a
              medium-dose, 6-day intermittent metronomic schedule induced
              strong IFN signaling but comparatively weak immune cell
              infiltration associated with long-term tumor growth stasis.
              Induction of IFN signaling was somewhat weaker in E0771 tumors
              but was followed by extensive downstream gene responses, robust
              immune cell infiltration and prolonged tumor regression. The
              immune dependence of these effective anti-tumor responses was
              established by CD8 T-cell immunodepletion, which blocked
              cyclophosphamide-induced E0771 tumor regression and led to tumor
              stasis followed by regrowth. Strikingly, IFN$\alpha$/$\beta$
              receptor-1 antibody blockade was even more effective in
              preventing E0771 immune cell infiltration and blocked the major
              tumor regression induced by cyclophosphamide treatment. Type-I
              IFN signaling is thus essential for the robust chemo-immunogenic
              response of these TNBC tumors to cyclophosphamide administered on
              a metronomic schedule. Significance TNBC has poor prognosis and
              few therapeutic options. We show that cyclophosphamide treatment
              can induces extensive tumor regression in syngeneic mouse models
              of TNBC via a chemo-immunogenic mechanism linked to type-I IFN
              production. Our findings establish that IFN signaling is
              essential for the robust anti-tumor actions of cyclophosphamide
              and suggest that treatment resistance may stem from silencing the

              findings from controlled laboratory experiments so far lack
              translation to animals, including humans, in their natural
              environment. In order to appreciate the breadth of eosinophil
              phenotype under non-laboratory, uncontrolled conditions, we
              exploit a free-living population of the model organism Mus
              musculus domesticus. Eosinophils were present at significantly
              higher proportions in the spleen and bone marrow of wild mice
              compared with laboratory mice. Strikingly, the majority of
              eosinophils of wild mice exhibited a unique Ly6Ghi phenotype
              seldom described in laboratory literature. Ly6G expression
              correlated with activation status in spleen and bone marrow, but
              not peritoneal exudate cells, and is therefore likely not an
              activation marker per se. Intermediate Ly6G expression was
              transiently induced in a small proportion of eosinophils from
              C57BL/6 laboratory mice during acute infection with the whipworm
              Trichuris muris, but not during low-dose chronic infection, which
              better represents parasite exposure in the wild. We conclude that
              the natural state of the eosinophil is not adequately reflected
              in the standard laboratory mouse, which compromises our attempts
              to dissect their functional relevance. Our findings emphasize the

                 cells to support angiogenesis and immunosuppression.
                 Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment [called
                 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)] often support tumor
                 growth and metastatic progression. Using a mix of in vivo and
                 coculture work with primary macrophages, Gomez et al. found
                 that secretion of the cytokine TGF-$\beta$ from
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs suppressed the abundance of succinate
                 dehydrogenase in breast cancer cells. The loss of this
                 metabolic enzyme promoted glycolysis, thereby enhancing tumor
                 growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Depleting
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs or blocking TGF-$\beta$ suppressed
                 these effects in vivo. The findings reveal a metabolic
                 mechanism underlying the protumorigenic roles of TAMs.
                 Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can exist in pro- and
                 anti-inflammatory states. Anti-inflammatory TAMs (also
                 referred to as M2-polarized) generally suppress antitumor
                 immune responses and enhance the metastatic progression of
                 cancer. To explore the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
                 isolated macrophages from mice and humans, polarized them ex
                 vivo, and examined their functional interaction with breast
                 cancer cells in culture and in mice. We found that
                 anti-inflammatory TAMs promoted a metabolic state in breast
                 cancer cells that supported various protumorigenic phenotypes.
                 Anti-inflammatory TAMs secreted the cytokine TGF-$\beta$ that,
                 upon engagement of its receptors in breast cancer cells,
                 suppressed the abundance of the transcription factor STAT1
                 and, consequently, decreased that of the metabolic enzyme
                 succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the tumor cells. The decrease
                 in SDH levels in tumor cells resulted in an accumulation of
                 succinate, which enhanced the stability of the transcription
                 factor HIF1$\alpha$ and reprogrammed cell metabolism to a
                 glycolytic state. TAM depletion-repletion experiments in a 4T1
                 mouse model additionally revealed that anti-inflammatory
                 macrophages promoted HIF-associated vascularization and
                 expression of the immunosuppressive protein PD-L1 in tumors.
                 The findings suggest that anti-inflammatory TAMs promote
                 tumor-associated angiogenesis and immunosuppression by
                 altering metabolism in breast cancer cells.",

              certain epigenetic and transcriptional regulators drive cancer
              metastasis and could be targeted for metastasis treatment. To
              identify epigenetic regulators of breast cancer metastasis, we
              profiled the transcriptomes of matched pairs of primary breast
              tumors and metastases from human patients. We found that distant
              metastases are more immune inert with increased M2 macrophages
              compared to their matched primary tumors. The acetyl-lysine
              reader, cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 2 (CECR2),
              was the top up-regulated epigenetic regulator in metastases
              associated with an increased abundance of M2 macrophages and
              worse metastasis-free survival. CECR2 was required for breast
              cancer metastasis in multiple mouse models, with more profound
              effect in the immunocompetent setting. Mechanistically, the
              nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) family member v-rel avian
              reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RELA) recruits
              CECR2 to increase chromatin accessibility and activate the
              expression of their target genes. These target genes include
              multiple metastasis-promoting genes, such as TNC, MMP2, and
              VEGFA, and cytokine genes CSF1 and CXCL1, which are critical for
              immunosuppression at metastatic sites. Consistent with these

              NF-$\kappa$B-mediated immune suppression by macrophages and
              inhibited breast cancer metastasis. These results reveal that

              smoking or alcohol, patients with HPV+ OPSCC, have better
              survival and the mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: The Cancer
              Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was examined for genes associated
              with tissue-resident CD8+ T cells. Multiplex immunohistochemistry
              (IHC) staining was performed on tumor specimen taken from 35 HPV+
              and 27 HPV- OPSCC patients. RESULTS: TCGA database revealed that
              the expression of genes encoding CD103 and CD69 were
              significantly higher in HPV+ head and neck SCCs (HNSCC) than in
              HPV- HNSCC. Higher expression levels of these two genes were also
              associated with better overall survival. IHC staining showed that
              the proportion of CD103+ tumor-resident CD8+ T cells were
              significantly higher in HPV+ OPSCCs when compared to HPV- OPSCC.
              This higher level was also associated with both lower risk of
              loco-regional failure, and better overall survival. Importantly,
              patients with HPV- OPSCC who had comparable levels of CD103+
              tumor-resident CD8+ T cells to those with HPV+ OPSCC demonstrated
              similar survival as those with HPV+OPSCC. CONCLUSION: Our results
              show that CD103+ tumor-resident CD8+ T cells are critical for
              protective immunity in both types of OPSCCs. Our data further
              suggest that the enhanced local protective immunity provided by
              tumor-resident T cell responses is the underlying factor driving

              beneficial implications for tumor surveillance and control. The
              current study aimed to clarify the less known chemotactic
              mechanisms that govern the localization, retention, and residency
              of memory CD8 T cells in the ovarian tumor microenvironment.
              EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RNA and protein expressions of chemokine
              receptors in CD8+ resident memory T cells in human ovarian
              tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and their association with
              survival were analyzed. The role of CXCR6 on antitumor T cells
              was investigated using prophylactic vaccine models in murine

              CD8+CD103+ resident memory tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in
              patients with ovarian cancer revealed high expression of CXCR6.
              Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (ovarian cancer
              database revealed CXCR6 to be associated with CD103 and increased
              patient survival. Functional studies in mouse models of ovarian
              cancer revealed that CXCR6 is a marker of resident, but not
              circulatory, tumor-specific memory CD8+ T cells. CXCR6-deficient
              tumor-specific CD8+ T cells showed reduced retention in tumor

              control of ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR6, by promoting
              retention in tumor tissues, serves a critical role in resident
              memory T cell-mediated immunosurveillance and control of ovarian
              cancer. Future studies warrant exploiting CXCR6 to promote

              malignant cells endowed with 'stemness' properties, such as
              self-renewing, multipotency and tumorigenicity. They are
              responsible for tumor initiation and progression, and could be
              associated with resistance to immunotherapies by negatively
              regulating antitumor immune response and acquiring molecular
              features enabling escape from CD8 T-cell immunity. However, the
              immunological hallmarks of human lung CSC and their potential
              interactions with resident memory T (TRM) cells within the tumor
              microenvironment have not been investigated. METHODS: We
              generated a non-small cell lung cancer model, including CSC line
              and clones, and autologous CD8+CD103+ TRM and CD8+CD103- non-TRM
              clones, to dissect out immune properties of CSC and their
              susceptibility to specific T-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity.
              RESULTS: Unlike their parental tumor cells, lung CSC are
              characterized by the initiation of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal
              transition program defined by upregulation of the SNAIL1
              transcription factor and downregulation of
              phosphorylated-GSK-3$\beta$ and cell surface E-cadherin.
              Acquisition of a CSC profile results in partial resistance to
              TRM-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, which correlates with decreased
              surface expression of the CD103 ligand E-cadherin and human
              leukocyte antigen-A2-neoepitope complexes. On the other hand, CSC
              gained expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and
              thereby sensitivity to leukocyte function-associated antigen
              (LFA)-1-dependent non-TRM-cell-mediated killing. Cytotoxicity is
              inhibited by anti-ICAM-1 and anti-major histocompatibility
              complex class I neutralizing antibodies further emphasizing the
              role of LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction in T-cell receptor-dependent
              lytic function. CONCLUSION: Our data support the rational design
              of immunotherapeutic strategies targeting CSC to optimize their
              responsiveness to local CD8+CD103+ TRM cells for more efficient

              immunotherapies have significantly reduced the recurrence rate in
              high-risk patients with stage III melanoma compared with surgery
              alone. However, 48\% of anti-PD-1-treated patients will develop
              recurrent disease within 4 years. There is a need to identify
              biomarkers of recurrence after adjuvant ICI to enable
              identification of patients in need of alternative treatment
              strategies. As cytotoxic T cells are critical for the antitumor
              response to anti-PD-1, we sought to determine whether specific
              subsets were predictive of recurrence in anti-PD-1-treated
              high-risk patients with stage III melanoma. METHODS: Associations
              with recurrence in patients with stage III melanoma were sought

              nivolumab/pembrolizumab$\pm$low-dose/low-interval ipilimumab.
              Multiplex immunohistochemistry was used to quantify intratumoral
              CD8+ T-cell populations using phenotypical markers CD39, CD103,
              and PD-1. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 19.3 months, 37/103
              (36\%) of patients had a recurrence. Two CD8+ T-cell
              subpopulations were significantly associated with recurrence.
              First, CD39+ tumor-resident memory cells (CD39+CD103+PD-1+CD8+
              (CD39+ Trm)) comprised a significantly higher proportion of CD8+
              T cells in recurrence-free patients (p=0.0004). Conversely,
              bystander T cells (CD39-CD103-PD-1-CD8+) comprised a
              significantly greater proportion of T cells in patients who
              developed recurrence (p=0.0002). Spatial analysis identified that
              CD39+ Trms localized significantly closer to melanoma cells than
              bystander T cells. Multivariable analysis confirmed significantly
              improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients with a high
              proportion of intratumoral CD39+ Trms (1-year RFS high 78.1\% vs
              low 49.9\%, HR 0.32, 95\% CI 0.15 to 0.69), no complete lymph
              node dissection performed, and less advanced disease stage (HR
              2.85, 95\% CI 1.13 to 7.19, and HR 1.29, 95\% CI 0.59 to 2.82).
              The final Cox regression model identified patients who developed
              recurrence with an area under the curve of 75.9\% in the
              discovery cohort and 69.5\% in a separate validation cohort
              (n=33) to predict recurrence status at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS:
              Adjuvant immunotherapy-treated patients with a high proportion of
              CD39+ Trms in their baseline melanoma resection have a
              significantly reduced risk of melanoma recurrence. This
              population of T cells may not only represent a biomarker of RFS
              following anti-PD-1 therapy, but may also be an avenue for

              (TIL) is associated with prolonged survival in high-grade serous

              most strongly associated with intraepithelial versus intrastromal
              CD8(+) TILs; however, the mechanisms that promote the
              intraepithelial localization of TILs remain poorly understood. We

              mucosal intraepithelial lymphocytes, might express CD103, a
              subunit of $\alpha$E/$\beta$7 integrin, which binds E-cadherin on
              epithelial cells. METHODS: A large collection of primary ovarian
              tumors (HGSC, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell) was
              analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of
              TIL-expressing CD103. The activation and differentiation status
              of CD103(+) TILs were assessed by flow cytometry. The prognostic
              significance of TIL subsets was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier
              analysis. RESULTS: CD103(+) TILs were present in all major
              ovarian cancer subtypes and were most abundant in HGSC. CD103(+)
              TILs were preferentially localized to epithelial regions of

              expressing activation (HLA-DR, Ki-67, PD-1) and cytolytic (TIA-1)

              occur in less than half of those treated, and efforts to improve
              treatment efficacy are confounded by a lack of understanding of
              the characteristics of the cells that initiate antitumor immune
              response.Patients and Methods: We performed multiparameter flow
              cytometry and quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence staining
              on tumor specimens from immunotherapy-na{\"\i}ve melanoma
              patients and longitudinal biopsy specimen obtained from patients
              undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy.Results: Increased numbers of
              CD69+CD103+ tumor-resident CD8+ T cells were associated with
              improved melanoma-specific survival in immunotherapy-na{\"\i}ve
              melanoma patients. Local IL15 expression levels strongly
              correlated with these tumor-resident T-cell numbers. The
              expression of several immune checkpoints including PD-1 and LAG3
              was highly enriched in this subset, and these cells significantly
              expanded early during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.Conclusions:
              Tumor-resident CD8+ T-cell numbers are more prognostic than total
              CD8+ T cells in metastatic melanoma. In addition, they are likely
              to initiate response to anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 treatments. We
              propose that the immune profile of these cells prior to treatment

              vulnerabilities of this state have been identified. Using
              selective small molecules as cellular probes, we show that
              induction of EMT greatly sensitizes cells to agents that perturb
              endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. This sensitivity to ER
              perturbations is caused by the synthesis and secretion of large
              quantities of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins by EMT cells.
              Consistent with their increased secretory output, EMT cells
              display a branched ER morphology and constitutively activate the
              PERK-eIF2$\alpha$ axis of the unfolded protein response (UPR).
              Protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) activation is also
              required for EMT cells to invade and metastasize. In human tumor
              tissues, EMT gene expression correlates strongly with both ECM
              and PERK-eIF2$\alpha$ genes, but not with other branches of the
              UPR. Taken together, our findings identify a novel vulnerability
              of EMT cells, and demonstrate that the PERK branch of the UPR is
              required for their malignancy. SIGNIFICANCE: EMT drives tumor
              metastasis and drug resistance, highlighting the need for
              therapies that target this malignant subpopulation. Our findings

              microenvironment of gastric adenocarcinoma were CD69+CD103+ Trm

              PD-1, TIGIT, and CD39 and represented tumor-reactive TILs.
              Instead of utilizing glucose, Trm cells relied on fatty acid

              in Trm cell death. In a tumor cell-T-cell coculture system,

              expressed only on a subset of immune cells leads to durable
              responses in advanced melanoma. Tissue-resident memory T (TRM)
              cells have recently emerged as a distinct subset of memory T

              lymphocytes (TILs) differ from those of blood T cells. TILs
              secrete less IL-2, IFN-$\gamma$, and TNF-$\alpha$ compared with
              circulating counterparts, and expression of VEGF correlated with
              reduced TIL infiltration. Within tumors, ICPs are particularly
              enriched within T cells with phenotype and genomic features of
              TRM cells and the CD16+ subset of myeloid cells. Concurrent T

              tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are maintained are poorly
              understood and are difficult to assess in spontaneous disease. We
              exploited an autochthonous model of breast cancer for
              high-resolution imaging of the early and later stages of tumor
              residence to understand the relationships between cellular
              behaviors and cellular phenotypes. ``Dysfunctional''
              differentiation began within the first days of tumor residence
              with an initial phase in which T cells arrest, largely on
              tumor-associated macrophages. Within 10 days, cellular motility
              increased and resembled a random walk, suggesting a relative
              absence of TCR signaling. We then studied the concurrent and
              apparently contradictory phenomenon that many of these cells

                 accumulation of bone marrow-derived cells in various tissues,
                 and these cells can enhance metastatic tumor growth by several
                 mechanisms. 4T1 murine mammary tumors are known to produce
                 granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and increase the
                 numbers of immunosuppressive CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid-derived
                 suppressor cells (MDSCs) in tissues such as the spleen and
                 lungs of tumor-bearing mice. While surgical resection of
                 primary tumors decreases MDSC levels in the spleen, the
                 longevity and impact of MDSCs and other immune cells in the
                 lungs after tumor resection have been less studied. METHODS:
                 We used mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF) and flow
                 cytometry to quantify MDSCs in the spleen, peripheral blood,
                 and lungs of mice bearing orthotopic murine mammary tumors. We
                 also tested the effect of primary tumor resection and/or
                 gemcitabine treatment on the levels of MDSCs, other immune
                 suppressor and effector cells, and metastatic tumor cells in
                 the lungs. RESULTS: We have found that, similar to mice with
                 4T1 tumors, mice bearing metastatic 4T07 tumors also exhibit
                 accumulation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSCs in the spleen and lungs,
                 while tissues of mice with non-metastatic 67NR tumors do not
                 contain MDSCs. Mice with orthotopically implanted 4T1 tumors
                 have increased granulocytic (G-) MDSCs, monocytic (M-) MDSCs,
                 macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells in the lungs. Resection
                 of primary 4T1 tumors decreases G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs, and
                 macrophages in the lungs within 48 h, but significant numbers
                 of functional immunosuppressive G-MDSCs persist in the lungs
                 for 2 weeks after tumor resection, indicative of an
                 environment that can promote metastatic tumor growth. The
                 chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine depletes G-MDSCs, M-MDSCs,
                 macrophages, and eosinophils in the lungs of 4T1 tumor-bearing
                 mice, and we found that treating mice with gemcitabine after
                 primary tumor resection decreases residual G-MDSCs in the
                 lungs and decreases subsequent metastatic growth. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Our data support the development of therapeutic strategies to
                 target MDSCs and to monitor MDSC levels before and after

              TILs in the intratumoral (i.e., intraepithelial) and stromal
              regions of NSCLC were estimated using immunohistochemistry and

              compared to low E-cadherin expression (P = 0.021). According to

              analysis revealed that a high number of intratumoral CD103+ TILs
              is an independent predictor of a more favorable DFS (P = 0.021).

              cell function. To safeguard this process in the face of
              environmental threats and internal stressors, cells mount an
              evolutionarily conserved response known as the unfolded protein
              response (UPR). Invading pathogens induce cellular stress that
              impacts protein folding, thus the UPR is well situated to sense
              danger and contribute to immune responses. Cytokines
              (inflammatory cytokines and interferons) critically mediate host
              defense against pathogens, but when aberrantly produced, may also
              drive pathologic inflammation. The UPR influences cytokine
              production on multiple levels, from stimulation of pattern
              recognition receptors, to modulation of inflammatory signaling
              pathways, and the regulation of cytokine transcription factors.
              This review will focus on the mechanisms underlying cytokine
              regulation by the UPR, and the repercussions of this relationship
              for infection and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases.
              Interrogation of viral and bacterial infections has revealed
              increasing numbers of examples where pathogens induce or modulate
              the UPR and implicated UPR-modulated cytokines in host response.
              The flip side of this coin, the UPR/ER stress responses have been

                 Assessing the roles of neutrophils can be challenging,

              immunity, nevertheless many questions are still open. Thus, even
              though memory T cells have been implicated in long-term
              anti-tumor protection, particularly in prevention of cancer
              recurrence, the bases of their variable effectiveness in tumor
              patients are poorly understood. Two types of memory T cells have
              been described according to their traffic pathways: recirculating
              and tissue-resident memory T cells. Recirculating tumor-specific
              memory T cells are found in the cell infiltrate of solid tumors,
              in the lymph and in the peripheral blood, and they constantly
              migrate in and out of lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.
              Tissue-resident tumor-specific memory T cells (TRM) permanently
              reside in the tumor, providing local protection. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1,
              a type of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, can
              considerably re-invigorate T cell response and lead to successful
              tumor control, even in patients at advanced stages. Indeed, ICB
              has led to unprecedented successes against many types of cancers,
              starting a ground-breaking revolution in tumor therapy.
              Unfortunately, not all patients are responsive to such treatment,
              thus further improvements are urgently needed. The mechanisms
              underlying resistance to ICB are still largely unknown. A better
              knowledge of the dynamics of the immune response driven by the
              two types of memory T cells before and after anti-PD-1/PD-L1
              would provide important insights on the variability of the
              outcomes. This would be instrumental to design new treatments to
              overcome resistance. Here we provide an overview of T cell
              contribution to immunity against solid tumors, focusing on memory
              T cells. We summarize recent evidence on the involvement of
              recirculating memory T cells and TRM in anti-PD-1/PD-L1-elicited
              antitumor immunity, outline the open questions in the field, and
              propose that a synergic action of the two types of memory T cells
              is required to achieve a full response. We argue that a T-centric
              vision focused on the specific roles and the possible interplay
              between TRM and recirculating memory T cells will lead to a
              better understanding of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mechanism of action, and

               Mechanistically, YIPF5 interacts with both STING and components

              Here, we probe IRE1$\alpha$ complexes in cells with blue native
